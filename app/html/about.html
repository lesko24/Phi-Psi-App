Phi Kappa Psi was founded February 19, 1852 by William Henry Letterman and Charles Page Thomas Moore in Canonsburg, PA at Jefferson College. Many nights of caring for sick friends during an outbreak of thyroid fever gave the founders a deep appreciation of service which led to the eventual founding of Phi Psi in recognition of these ideals. Phi Kappa Psi was originally formed as a secret society on Swarthmore College in 1888. During the early 1900’s Phi Kappa Psi was one of ten fraternities and sororities on campus. The house that currently holds the fraternity was erected in 1921. In 1933 the campus abolished sororities and the influence of fraternities began to decline. In 1951, with five remaining fraternities on campus, a student petition led to a Student Council referendum on abolishing fraternities. Fortunately the student body chose to keep the fraternities. In the late 1950’s Phi Kappa Psi had its national charter revoked for admitting a black student into its membership. The fraternity formally broke away from its national organization in 1963 in a dispute over discrimination against black and Jewish students. Now autonomous, the fraternity became known as Phi Omicron Psi, and is now known simply as Phi Psi Fraternity. It was at the beginning of this tumultuous period that Elron, the fraternity heirloom became a member. For more, click here.

The number of fraternities at Swarthmore has dwindled leaving Phi Psi as one of only two remaining fraternities. However Phi Psi remains a very healthy organization with strong institutional support from the college and looks to continue thriving. The past few years fraternity membership has been roughly 30. Academically brothers are currently pursuing diverse degrees in such fields as Economics, Engineering, Biology, Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, Biochemistry, Political Science and others. Many brothers are Honors majors, while others are pursuing double majors or following pre-med programs. Brothers participate on a variety of sports teams including lacrosse, basketball, swimming, golf, ultimate frisbee, and soccer. Brothers are also currently actively involved on campus with current members participating on or having participated on such groups as Student Budget Committee, Social Affairs Committee, Student Athlete Advisory Committee, The Phoenix, Garnet Club, the Writing Associate program, and others. Phi Psi brothers are also very active in the community, participating in house sponsored events such as our annual Thanksgiving Food Drive, and individually through activities such as tutoring in Chester through the Dare 2 Soar program, and volunteering in such programs as Students Serving Homeless in Philadelphia (SHIP) and TOPSoccer.

Phi Psi Fraternity prides itself on its openness and any student interested in pledging the fraternity should contact one of the officers. Entrance to any Phi Psi event, whether S.A.C. funded or not, is never exclusive to the brothers or a guest list: the entire student body is always welcome. Finally, the fraternity remains open to any suggestions from the student body, the College, or the greater Swarthmore community. Again, contact one of our officers.
